# Module 2 - Multiple Year Stock Data

## Background

The script will loop through all stocks in one year and output:

 * The ticker symbol.
 * Yearly change from opening price at the beginning of a given year to the closing price at the end of that year.
 * The percent change from opening price at the beginning of a given year to the closing price at the end of that year.
 * The total stock volume of the stock.
 * Two columns are conditionally formated to highly gains vs losses.
 * The greatest % increase.
 * The greatest % decrease.
 * The greatest total volume.


### Files

* multiple_year_stock_data.vbs - Script file containing all code.

* Multiple_year_stock_data.xlsm - Macro-Enabled Excel file containing stock trade data by year.

* ScreenShots.docx - Screen shots of 2018, 2019, and 2020 worksheets after a single execution of the code.


## Instructions

* The script will run on any worksheet or worksheets contained in a single workbook as long as the first seven columns are standard. (See Multiple_year_stock_data.xlsm.)
* The script will iterate through all worksheets so only worksheets containing stock data in the correct format should be included in the workbook.
